*All the setup I need to do on a fresh install*

**How to execute?**

Run the following in your terminal:

```shell
chmod +x forTheFirstTime.sh

```

The script `forTheFirstTime.sh` does the following to my system

1. Generate ssh key for aws
2. Setup fish
3. Install Powerline-fonts
4. Install solarized theme for terminal
5. Setup python3 (pip and aliases)
6. Install Sublime Text 3
7. Ctrl + Shift + P tasks
    - Install the OneDark theme (the material one inspired by Atom) for Sublime
    - Install SublimeLinter
    - Install PEP8 Linter
    - Install pycodestyle
    - Install any other plugin if recall
8. Copy `sublime_settings.json` to Sublime preferences
9. Setup git profile and git aliases in terminal
10. Set desktop wallpaper (https://financesonline.com/uploads/2014/03/mansion.jpg)


Once everything is done, reboot the system
